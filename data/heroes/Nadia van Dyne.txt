==Fictional character biography==
It was revealed that Hank Pym had a daughter named Nadia through Maria Trovaya who was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents.

After earning the trusts of the Avengers after stabilizing Vision, Edwin Jarvis took Nadia on a road trip to meet her extended family.<ref name="Nadia" /> Nadia meets Janet and spends the day with her. They save the president and then have a moment together.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #12</ref> It soon becomes apparent that Nadia was out of touch with reality, believing that everything could be fixed by her science skills because "she was good". However, despite learning the harsh truth of reality, Janet comforted her and felt she had the potential to become a true hero.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #14</ref>

Nadia soon joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and gains [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizenship]]. Upon realizing that the most intelligent women on [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s index don't list any women above the 27th place, she jump starts the program G.I.R.L. (Genius In action Research Labs) to look for women with genius intellects.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #1-2</ref> When deciding her legal name, Nadia realizes that she can't take the name 'Pym' as she never knew much about her biological mother and father. She decides to take the surname 'van Dyne' as Janet was the only person there for her and believed in her success.<ref>''The Unstoppable Wasp'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Making use of the cellular implantation of sub-atomic Pym particles, the Wasp possesses the power to alter her physical size, causing her body's mass to be shunted to or gained from an alternate dimension known as Kosmos. She is able to shrink to a minimum of several centimeters or grow to a maximum of several hundred feet. Smaller or larger sizes are possible but the exertion puts a strain on her body. 

==Other versions==
